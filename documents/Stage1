This first stage is an important first step used to conceptualize and plan the portfolio project. I am taking care of this planning by myself as the sole member of this team but this does not mean that I skip the brainstorming process, on the contrary I have to challenge my own ideas.
After some thinking, hesitating between e-commerce ideas, I thought of a topic that seems more useful for everyone involved: a website used by private tutors to promote their work and for potential clients to meet them.
The other ideas I had didnâ€™t seem bad enough to reject them but I do find this subject much more interesting as this kind of business usually happens through word of mouth: a website would make it much easier for the people who need it.
The steps i will be taking during this project are as such
1. The creation of the plan; brainstorming about the ideas that could be implemented in this project and the organization that will be needed each week
2. The beginning of coding on the back-end
3. The start of testing to see if there are any problems
4. The creation of the front-end
5. The testing of the final product
